# IaC Use Cases

### Monitoring and Maintenance

- to ensure it remains in the desired state and meets performance, availability, and security requirements

### Version control

- can collaborate on infrastructure changes using standard version control practices and workflows
- to track changes, facilitate collaboration, and ensure audibility

### Automating IaC security scanning

- an effective way to identify and correct vulnerabilities at a specific moment in time
- to identify all the variables for which the proper settings are either missing or are incorrectly set
- checking templates, files, and modules and their variables against known [policies](Glossary%20af29591a425e40ed88168e70e015ec89.md)

### IaC Testing

- helps DevOps teams test applications in production-like environments early in the development cycle
- Test the state of everything â€“ from files, packages, users on a server to security groups on cloud resources
- Detect violations by comparing the actual state of systems with the desired state as defined in the policy
- Understand the security and compliance status of systems through detailed reports and plan remediation measures
- Scale policies across distributed systems and continuously test systems
- Streamline testing throughout the software delivery process
